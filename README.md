This repository contains scripts, workflows and build config for building
[darcs](http://darcs.net/).

## What is darcs?

Quoted from the darcs homepage:

> Darcs is a free and open source, cross-platform version control system, like
git, mercurial or svn but with a very different approach: focus on changes
rather than snapshots. Darcs offers a freer way of working, and a simpler user
interface. Darcs does not require a central server, and works perfectly in
offline mode.
